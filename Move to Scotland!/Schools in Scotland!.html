                Scotland's general <a href="https://www.scotland.org/live-in-scotland/school-systems">education system</a> is not unlike our own in the U.S..  Finding a school for your child is a fairly easy process thanks to the government's <a href="https://www.mygov.scot/register-your-child-for-a-school/">website</a>.  You can look deeper into the government's school <a href="https://www.gov.scot/policies/schools/">policies</a> as well if you like.
